# Google Performance Study

This is technically round 3, to supplement the original [oerformance study](https://github.com/converged-computing/performance-study) and the follow up [ebpf study](https://github.com/converged-computing/google-performance-study).

- [gke](gke) will test applications on Kubernetes
- [compute-engine](compute-engine) will do the same on Compute Engine!

For both, we will use `c4d-standard-96`
